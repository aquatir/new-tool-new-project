### Motivation

- Level 1: learn how gradle deeper

## About

### Part 1 — setup

This project is generated by executing `gradle init` and selecting multiple folders project. Then I applied

```shell
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.6
```

to update the wrapper to the latest available version. After that you can run `./gradlew run` to test if it works.

Use https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.dorongold.task-tree plugin to see a list of tasks that will be executed
```
./gradlew build taskTree
```

## Conclusion

**DISCLAIMER**: I write this chapter in the end of a project to summarize my learning about a new tool. This is heavily
biased opinion, and you should do your own research for any practical case.
