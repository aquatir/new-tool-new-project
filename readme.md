# new-tool-new-project

Jack of all trades, master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one.

Idea of this repo is to learn a bit about a lot of tools whenever I feel like it. I'll be mostly using Java but might add an extra
language. 

All projects will have a dedicated readme.md inside + an overview of what I managed to achieve in a short time span, usually a week. 
Those will mostly include official tutorials ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Navigate to any project to see for yourself.

# In Progress (project 5) — Nothing yet, it will be pg cluster with leader + replicate using I don't know what yet

project: —

# Facts

The older things I've competed. This list grows from newest to oldest.

- project 4 — [Cassandra](/project4-apache-cassandra). Docker-compose setup + Java client example with [Datastax](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).
- project 3 — [Terraform](/project3-terraform). Basic setup + AWS with modules.
- project 2 — [pgq](/project2-pgq). My failed attempt to even install PGQ :D
- project 1 — [Debezium](/project1-debezium). Docker compose setup + Java app to read topics

# Plans

The next few project I'd like to tackle.

## Plan 2023

- project 5: PostgreSQL leader + replicate setup + Patroni ??
- project 6: Postgres LISTEN / NOTIFY mechanism
- project 7: R2DBC https://r2dbc.io
- project 8: Cassandra 3-nodes setup + testing failover.
- project 9: k6 https://k6.io load testing tool by Grafana labs 

In no particular order:

- k9s Kubernetes client https://k9scli.io
- Quarkus https://quarkus.io
- Rust language https://www.rust-lang.org
- Map Reduce Lab from [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/).
- Trie (aka Prefix Trees?) data structure & algorithms using it.
- C++ — basic build tools, testing, setup
- ???
