# new-tool-new-project

Jack of all trades, master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one.

Idea of this repo is to learn a bit about a lot of tools whenever I feel like it. I'll be mostly using Java but might add an extra
language. 

All projects will have a dedicated readme.md inside + an overview of what I managed to achieve in a short time span, usually a week. 
Those will mostly include official tutorials ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Navigate to any project to see for yourself.

# In Progress (project 7) — Go language
