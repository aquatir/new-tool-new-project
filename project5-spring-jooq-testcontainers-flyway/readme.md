# Spring jooq testcontainers flyway

Run testcontainers PostgreSQL -> apply flyway migrations -> generate jOOQ classes.



## Project 5 â€” Spring jooq testcontainers flyway 

### Motivation

- Level 1: learn how to do it via gradle without relying on external scripts

### Links

- Revolut plugin which does exactly that https://github.com/revolut-engineering/jooq-plugin

## Conclusion

Works as intended but looks ugly. Should not be an issue if you hide it in your own plugin
