# Terraform

A tool + language to enable infrastructure as code.

Web site: https://www.terraform.io

## Projecct 2 â€” Terraform

### Motivation

- Level 0: learn how to read terraform code.
- Level 1: figure out how to do multi-environment deployments

### Links

- [intro](/project3-terraform/intro). The first Terraform config with local Docker.
- [changing-infra](/project3-terraform/changing-infra). Introduce a change to existing infrastructure and see to apply it.
- [modules](/project3-terraform/modules). Extract common config into a module (e.g. different envs) AND use one of the predefined
modules.

## Conclusion

**DISCLAIMER**: I write this chapter in the end of a project to summarize my learning about a new tool. This is heavily biased
opinion, and you should do your own research for any practical case. 

I really enjoyed learning about Terraform this project. Partially because it seems to be a *sain* tool which makes sensible 
enough decisions, partially because the official tutorials are so good. I initially decided to learn it because we use 
it at work, and it seems to be conquering the infra-as-code space. Now I will even recommend it. The most awesome 
features that I found:

- Avoid leaking abstractions. It doesn't attempt to define a single infra for multiple cloud, because clouds are so different. 
Instead, it gives you a set of tools like modules and config vars to configure infra the way you want it.
- Validation, state and dry-run option built it. I think all 3 of those are the absolut requirements for any infra-as-code 
tool since it's executing a wrong command is so dangerous. The state allow you to bring existing infrastructure into 
Terraform which is a nice addition.
- I did not need to use stackoverflow at all because the official docs provide all the answers. 
- No surprises approach. Say you have a sensitive variable. What should happen if you output it as part of string 
interpolation? An error! Such cases of no-surprises approach is yet another reason for me to like Terraform.
