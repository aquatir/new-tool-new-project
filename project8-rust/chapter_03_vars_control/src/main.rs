    // shadowing: this will first print 12, due to inner block, then print 6 because we have exited the inner block

    // Rust also have types.
    // In the example below, you could drop the explicit types, but then a would become i32 as it's a default, not u32

    // Rust also have arrays
    // you specify the size of the array in type. Rust will figure out a type if you don't do it
    let _months: [&str; 12] = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
        "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];

    // knowing the type of the array, Rust knows that certain operations are invalid
    // println!("the 12th month is: {}", _months[12]) // Doesn't compile
