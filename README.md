# new-tool-every-week
Jack of all trades, master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one.

Idea of this repo is to learn a bit about a lot of tools every week. I'll be mostly using Java but might add an extra language. 

All projects will have a dedicated readme.md inside. + An overview of what I managed to achieve in a week on this page.
