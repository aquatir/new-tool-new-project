# new-tool-every-week

Jack of all trades, master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one.

Idea of this repo is to learn a bit about a lot of tools every week. I'll be mostly using Java but might add an extra
language. 

All projects will have a dedicated readme.md inside + an overview of what I managed to achieve in a week. Those will mostly 
include official tutorials ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Navigate to any project to see for yourself.

# In Progress (week 2) — Terraform
